                I have spent most of my life learning and developing the
                necessary mindset to become an ultra-successful producer in the
                insurance and investment businesses where I discovered
                consistent predictable strategies, behaviors, and ways of
                thinking that I used to achieve extraordinary goals and income
                levels.

                The outset of my journey was fraught with formidable challenges,
                surpassing the typical hurdles encountered by most individuals.
                From the loss of my father when I was just four months old, to
                academic setbacks resulting in my departure from college, to the
                humbling experience of working as a janitor, to enduring the
                tragic suicide of three family members, and even falling victim
                to a multi-million-dollar scamâ€”these were but a few of the
                trials I faced.

                However, my ability to overcome and navigate these adversities,
                eventually achieving the levels of success I did, can be
                attributed to my unwavering commitment to{" "}

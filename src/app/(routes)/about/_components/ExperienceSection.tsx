                  I have spent most of my life learning and developing the
                  necessary mindset to become an ultra-successful producer in
                  the insurance and investment businesses where I discovered
                  consistent predictable strategies, behaviors, and ways of
                  thinking that I used to achieve extraordinary goals and income
                  levels.

                  The outset of my journey was fraught with formidable
                  challenges, surpassing the typical hurdles encountered by most
                  individuals. From the loss of my father when I was just four
                  months old, to academic setbacks resulting in my departure
                  from college, to the humbling experience of working as a
                  janitor, to enduring the tragic suicide of three family
                  members, and even falling victim to a multi-million-dollar
                  scamâ€”these were but a few of the trials I faced.

                  However, my ability to overcome and navigate these
